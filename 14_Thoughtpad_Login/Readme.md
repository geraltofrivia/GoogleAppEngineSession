This is the final application that we intended to make for our session
Due to time constraints, we could not make a really robust application
There are some issues regarding the Google User, if you handle multiple accounts
Also, as of now there is no way that one could edit previous contents. 

If time allows, try to implement such features in the app. It would be an awesome learning experience (plus you can use the app)
